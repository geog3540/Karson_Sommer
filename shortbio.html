         <p class="card-text">My research focuses on developing new theories, methodologies and applications to help extract and
           understand complex patterns from large geo-social networks, i.e., networks embedded in geographic space and time such as
           migration, human mobility, commodity flows and information flows. Geo-social networks are formed by flows of physical entities
           (e.g., movements of humans, vehicles, sensors, animals), and communication (e.g., information, ideas, innovation, personal communication)
           that connect places to places and individuals to individuals. Given the complexity introduced by highly interacting systems of geo-social networks,
           solving a real-world problem often need to simultaneously consider the geographic, temporal and network components that form the system and relationships
           among them. For example, disease spread is influenced by many factors such as human mobility, social ties, population dynamics,
           transportation infrastructure and seasonal changes in weather, and the relationships among these factors.
           Human migration is driven by not only the availability of jobs or average temperature at a destination place but also the
           availability of family and friendship ties. During an emergency, knowing how information diffuses among geographic locations
           and through a network of social actors is crucial for managing situational awareness and assisting emergency management. </p>
